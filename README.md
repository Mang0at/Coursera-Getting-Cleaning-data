# This repository hosts my files for the Data Science Getting and Cleaning Data week 4 project

Contents are:

run_analysis.R = the R script created based on instructions provided
final_data.txt = the output of the above R script
CodeBook.md = a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data

Course instructions are:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
